**Hosting and managing parts for Free Range Engineering designs**

The **fre-plm-parts** repository is a centralized location for the parts, components, and data needed in the designs created by Free Range Engineering. This project leverages Git to provide version control, traceability, and efficient lifecycle management for the components used across various projects.

This repository builds upon the ideas and structure of the original [GitPLM Parts Project](https://github.com/git-plm/gitplm), adapting it for practical use in hosting actual design parts. We thank the GitPLM team for their foundational work in establishing Git-based approaches for managing parts libraries.

## Key Features

- **Git-Based Management**: All changes to parts are tracked in Git, providing version control and collaboration capabilities.
- **Centralized Repository**: A single repository hosts all parts needed for Free Range Engineering designs.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Parts are organized and managed with revisions to ensure consistency across projects.

## Directory Structure

- `database` - CSV files containing parts data and the SQLite database.
- `symbols` - KiCad symbols used in designs.
- `footprints` - KiCad footprints for components.

## Status

This repository is actively used for Free Range Engineering designs and serves as the backbone for managing components efficiently.
